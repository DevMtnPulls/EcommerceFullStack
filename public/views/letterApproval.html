        <p>Dear {{childFirstName}},</p>

        <p>Ho, Ho, Ho, Merry Christmas! {{ageToShow.list}}</p>

        <p>Your {{behaviorToShow.behavior}} told me you’ve been a very good {{genderToShow.gender}} this year, and that you would like {{prefixToShow.prefix}} {{presentType}} for Christmas. Well, I can’t promise every child will get what they ask for, but I can assure you, you’ll have a wonderful Christmas with your kind, loving family.</p>

        <p>{{childFirstName}}, I was walking through the toy workshop earlier today, when I saw The Elves wrapping a present for your {{friendToShow.friend}}, {{personalLtrData.friendName}}. I can’t tell you what I saw them wrapping because it will spoil the surprise but I can guarantee that {{personalLtrData.friendName}} will be delighted with it on Christmas morning!</p>

        <p>{{personalLtrData.paragraphToShow.para}}</p>

        <p>{{childFirstName}}, make sure you get to bed nice and early on Christmas Eve because Rudolph just showed me the route we’ll be flying, and guess where we’ll be coming? That’s right, to your house!</p>

        <p>Merry Christmas!<br>
          Love,<br>
          Santa Claus</p>
